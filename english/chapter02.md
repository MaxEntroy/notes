## Adverb

- An adverb is a word or an expression that generally modifies a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a determiner, a clause, a preposition, or a sentence. 
- Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, or level of certainty by answering questions such as how, in what way, when, where, to what extent. 
- This is called the adverbial function and may be performed by an individual adverb, by an adverbial phrase, or by an adverbial clause.

wikipedia的定义有3个点，分别是
- 语法：副词的作用是什么？用来修饰什么？
- 语义：语法是表面，语义是核心，要表达什么？
- 形式：单独副词，副词短语，副词单句
    - James answered immediately. (adverb)
    - James answered in English. (prepositional phrase)
    - James answered this morning. (noun phrase)
    - James answered in English because he had a foreign visitor. (adverbial clause)

## Phrase

wikipedia的解释
>A phrase is a group of words that adds meaning to a sentence. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject, verb and a predicate.

这里有一个强调是，不是句子。虽然是一个语法单元，但是没有构成句子的基本结构，及时最简单的也没有。简单说，没有构成主谓结构。

>In English there are five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main parts of speech. In a phrase, the main word, or the word that is what the phrase is about, is called the head. In these examples, it is printed in bold. The other words in the phrase do the work of changing or modifying the head.

这里讲了phrase的表现形式，本质是为了说head，然后增加了修饰语，构成了这样一个结构。

- In a 'Noun phrase', one or more words work together to give more information about a noun.[source?]
  - all my dear children
  - the information age
  - seventeen hungry lions in the rocks

- In an Adjective phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective.
  - so very sweet
  - earnest in her desire
  - very happy with his work

- In a Verb phrase, one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb. In English, the verb phrase is very complex, but a good description of its many forms can be found here.[better source needed]

- In an Adverb phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb.
  - especially softly
  - formerly of the city of Perth
  - much too quickly to see clearly

- In a Prepositional phrase, one or more words work together to give information about time, location, or possession, or condition. The preposition always appears at the front of the phrase (preposition = pre-position).
  - after a very long walk
  - behind the old building
  - for all the hungry children
  - in case it should happen again

## Conjuct

我看了wikipedia关于conjuct的讲解，我觉得非常清晰，反而比书里清晰。

In linguistics, the term conjunct has three distinct uses:
- A conjunct is an adverbial that adds information to the sentence that is not considered part of the propositional content (or at least not essential) but which connects the sentence with previous parts of the discourse. Rare as it may be, conjuncts may also connect to the following parts of the discourse.
    - It was raining. **Therefore**, we didn’t go swimming.
    - It was sunny. **However**, we stayed inside.
    - You are such a dork. **Still**, I love you from the bottom of my heart.

这个功能是最容易理解的，连接两个句子。

- A conjunct is one of the terms that are conjoined in a conjoining construction. Conjuncts are conjoined by means of a conjunction, which can be coordinating, subordinating or correlative. Conjuncts can be words, phrases, clauses, or full sentences.
    - [Gretchen and her daughter] bought [motor oil, spark plugs, and dynamite].
    - Take two of these and call me in the morning.

老实说，这个功能我不太理解。

- A verb form, for example the conjunct verb endings of Old Irish or the conjunct mood (sometimes called the subjunctive mood) of Algonquian languages.

这也是非常重要的一个功能，就是语气，mood.这个后面讲，暂时先不深入。

### Semantic functions

这一小节，我觉得是精华。那么连词的作用说了，连接两个句子，但是为什么需要连词连接呢？直接写两个句子不行吗？当然可以，但是连词的作用也就在这里。根据我之前考研的经历，其实我发现，英文当中句子和句子之间都有着非常微妙的关系。
那么，句子与句子之间的关系，靠什么语法结构来承载呢？这个语法结构就是连词。连词，除了表面上的连接两个句子，更重要的功能是表达两次句子之间的关系。就好比链表里面的指针一样。


English conjuncts often have the following functions

- Listing (indicating that what follows is a list of propositions)
    - To begin with, I have to tell you that I'm most displeased with your performance in the show. I also think you did a bad job painting the house. You're a lousy cook. You smell. Your hat is ... etc.
- Enumerative (indicating items on a list of propositions)
    - First, we have to buy bread. Second, we need to take the car to the garage. Third, we have to call your dentist and make an appointment.
- Additive (indicating that the content of the sentence is in addition to the preceding one)
    - He has no money. In addition, he has no means of getting any.
- Summative (summing up, or concluding, on the preceding sentence(s))
    - A is B. A is C. To sum up, A is several things.
- Appositive (rephrasing the preceding sentence)
    - The French love music. In other words, music is appreciated in France.(An appositive is a noun or pronoun — often with modifiers — set beside another noun or pronoun to explain or identify it. -- 同位结构)
- Resultative/inferential (indicating that the content of the sentence is a result of the events expressed in the preceding sentence)
    - Miss Gold lost her job. She, therefore, had no money.
- Antithetic (indicating that the content of the sentence is in contrast to the content of the preceding sentence)
    - It is said that water flows up hill. On the contrary, it flows downhill
- Concessive (indicating that the content of the sentence "exists" despite the content in the preceding sentence)
    - It is very cold. I went for my morning walk, however.
- Temporal (indicating temporal relation between the content of the sentence and the preceding sentence)
    - I had lunch. Meanwhile, my wife had her hair cut.
