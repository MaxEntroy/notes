## UML

- 基础

q:什么是uml?
>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system
>
>以上wiki的定义说的很清楚了，我再简化下，
1.建模语言
2.一种标准版化的工具
3.对系统设计进行可视化

q:uml是如何描述系统的?
>UML diagrams represent two different views of a system model:
* Static (or structural) view: emphasizes the static structure of the system using objects, attributes, operations and relationships. It includes class diagrams and composite structure diagrams.
* Dynamic (or behavioral) view: emphasizes the dynamic behavior of the system by showing collaborations among objects and changes to the internal states of objects. This view includes sequence diagrams, activity diagrams and state machine diagrams.
