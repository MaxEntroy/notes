#### Basic

- Aperture
    - In optics, the aperture of an optical system (including a system consisted of a single lens) is a hole or an opening 
    - that primarily limits light propagated through the system.

    - Reducing the aperture size (increasing the f-number) provides less light to sensor 
    - and also increases the depth of field 
        - (by limiting the angle of cone of image light reaching the sensor),
        - which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus.

- Focal length
    - The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light.
    - it is the inverse of the system's optical power.
    
简单来说，镜头焦段越长（数字越大），景深越浅，视角越窄；镜头焦段越短（数字越小），景深越大，视角越广.
- 短焦
    - 所以，一个短焦的镜头，可以保证景深。
    - 同时，配合小光圈，也可以保证景深。
- 长焦
    - 长焦镜头有压缩空间感的功能，把前景中景背景强行压成一层，减小他们在画面里的距离感
