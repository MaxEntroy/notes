## 第一章 句子的形成

### 第一节 可做主语的词类

#### 1.名词做主语

#### 2.代词做主语

#### 3.动名词或不定时短语做主语

- finite verbs
    - a finite verb form shows a particular tense(时态), person(人称) and number(单数/复数).

所谓体现句子的时间背景，是指该句子所讲述的究竟是过去？还是现在？还是将来？是指这种粗略的时间划分，而不是指明该句子讲述的是哪个具体时间点或时间段。

>tense: any of the forms of a verb that show the time, continuace, or completion of an action for state that is expressed by the verb.

- 'I am' is the present tense.
- 'I was' is past tense.
- 'I will be' is future tense.

tense is any of the forms of a verb that show the time and state.
- 过去？现在？将来？
- 是在进行？还是完成了？

eg:
```
I ate apples.
I eat apples.
I will eat apples.
```

通过ate/eat/will eat，我们指导事情是发生在什么时候？过去，现在，还是将来。

当句子中没有时间状语时，我们从 finite verb 就可以判断某件事情或者某个状态究竟是在过去，还是现在，还是将来。这就像汉语中的助词“着、了、过、会”一样，不能告诉我们具体时间，但是能告诉我们大体时间。这个就是finite verbs.

再来看 finite verb 体现主语的人称和数这个功能。

eg:
```
I am strong. 
We are strong.
You are strong.
He is strong.
She is strong.
It is strong.
They are strong.
```

上面这些句子中加粗加下划线的斜体字，之所以形式不一样，是因为主语的人称和数不一样。当主语是第一人称单数时，我们用了 am; 当主语是第二人称时，我们用来 are; 当主语是第三人称单数时，我们用了 is; 当主语是第三人称复数时，我们用了 are. 也就是说 finite verb 在形式上要受到主语的人称和数的限制，要和主语的人称和数保持一致。这就是所谓的 subject verb agreement (主谓一致)

讲finite verbs主要目的是给gerund做铺垫，后者是infinite verbs

- gerund
    - a word ending in "-ing" that is made from a verb and used like a noun
    - infinite verb
    - 不反应tense,person,number，没有主谓一致。
    - 但是他们能够表达状态

```
Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies.
Passing an rvalue container to the function is an edge case.
```

- infinitive with 'to'
    - 这个名字就非常清楚了，non-finite verb(in)
    - 看不出tense/person/number
    - 表达目的，计划之事

```
To study abroad is my greatest desire.
To go to Japan for a visit is my plan for this year.
```

#### 4.名词性从句做主语

In language, a clause is a constituent that comprises a semantic predicand (expressed or not) and a semantic predicate

从句这个翻译我觉得不好，还不如简单句，或者单句，构成一个完整语法单位的最小元素。我觉得还是叫单句比较好。

这一小节其实比较重要，因为它讲了句子是通过怎样的形式，构成更加复杂的句子。如果只是简单的增加一些形容词的修饰，并不会使得句子的结构变复杂。
真的可以使得句子结构变复杂的，还是句子之间的连接。所以，需要搞明白这种连接方式。即简单句构成复杂句子的连接方式。

```
He doesn't study makes me angry.(Wrong)
He doesn't study这是句子，不能直接充当主语。
一定要变成名词性从句才行。

That he doesn't study makes me angry.
```

- 分类
    - 成分角度
        - subjective clause
        - objective clause
        - predicative clause
        - appositive
    - 引导词角度
        - that clause
        - whether clause
        - interrogative clause

对于predicative clause做简单展开，
>A predicative expression (or just predicative) is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula or linking verb.
> The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject, but at times it can be the clause object.

跟在"系"词之后，用来修饰主语。

#### 5.名词短语做主语

名词短语 = 疑问词 + 不定时短语

#### 6.表距离的地点副词短语做主语

### 第二节 动词的种类及其用法

这一小节非常重要，可以说，动词是英语的灵魂。虽然句子的构成，如何连接，暂时不通过动词起作用。但是对于单句的分析，主要是看动词。

这一小节，厘清了过去的一些错误认知。过去对于修饰词的理解，我是按照名词修饰语和动词修饰语的角度来划分。这个办法帮我容易的分析句子，但是其中有些理解错误。比如object complementary，这个东西可以理解为名词修饰语，但实际上，他是oc。从句子的成分的理解，更容易理解句子的结构。

#### 1.动词基本可以分为五大类

- complete intransitive verb, c.vi
- incomplete intransitive verb, i.vi
- complete transitive verb. c.vt
- incomplete intransitivve verb. i.vt
- dative verb, d.v

>transitive: able to take a direct object 
dataive: the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective that in some languages marks the indirect object of a verb that has two objects

及物这个翻译有点抽象，可带宾语动词。其中，这个dative也比较特殊，双宾语。

当然，从上一小节得知，从另一个角度来说，即一个句子的动词是否反应tense/person/number又可以分为
- finite verbs
- infinite verbs

#### 2.如何判断vt/vi

- 我___他(主动)
- 他被我___(被动)
- 如果一个动词，可以填入上述结构，且语意正常，那么这是vt.

- 我杀(kill)他/他被我(杀),kill是vt.
- 我跳(dance)他/他被我(跳), 语意不符，dance是vi.

#### 3/4. 兼做vt/vi

- dream
    - I dreamed last night.
    - I dreamed a terrible dream last night.
- sing
    - He is singing.
    - He sings a song.

#### 5.c.vt/c.vi

这里完全，其实就是不加额外的complementary(subject complementary/object complementary)

- c.vt,加了宾语，不加complementary，意思很完整
    - He killed her.
    - I love my mom.
- c.vi,不加宾语，不加complementary，意思很完整
    - I dance, you dance, she dances.
    - He laughed.

#### 6.c.vt的形态

- a. s + cvt + o
    - He wrote a book.
- b. s + be verb + cvt-ing(present participle) + o
    - He was writing a book.
- c. s + be verb + cvt-ed(past participle) + o
    - The book was written by him.
- d. s + be verb + being + cvt-ed + o
    - A book was being written by him.

这里介绍participle的概念
>In linguistics, a participle (from Latin participium 'a sharing, partaking'; abbr. ptcp) is a nonfinite verb form that has some of the characteristics and functions of both verbs and adjectives.[1] More narrowly, participle has been defined as "a word derived from a verb and used as an adjective, as in a laughing face"

下面看一下对比：

- participle vs gerund
    - Present participles and gerunds look identical, but they have different grammatical functions:
    - Present participles are used in various verb tenses (e.g., “I have been eating”) and as adjectives (e.g., “a laughing child”).
    - Gerunds function as nouns (e.g., “I enjoy jogging”).

我觉得这里少强调了一点，participle是一个non-finite verb，所以可以体现动词的tense，进行时态都可以用present participle，过去时态都可以用past participle。同时，present/past participle兼做adj.而gerund功能非常单一，就是做名词。主要他们的形式看起来都是V-ing.

V-ing
    - present participle(both verb and adj)
        - tense of verb
        - adj.
    - gerund(n)
V-ed
    - past participle(both verb and adj)
        - tense of verb
        - past voice
        - adj
        
#### 7.c.vi的形态

- a. s + cvi
    - Something happend.
- b. s + be + cvi-ing(present participle)
    - Something was happening.
    - Something was happened.(wrong!!!). 
        - vi没有被动语态
        - 根据 2 中的内容，如果他有被动语态，那么它就是vt.
    - 可接adv，修饰动词，注意，这是状语，不是宾语。
        - adv. Something happened yesterday.
        - adv phrase.He died in an accident.
        - adv clause.He left because he didn't want to see mary again.

背景知识补充--状语

>An adverbial phrase is a group of words that acts like an adverb – i.e., it modifies a verb, adjective, adverb, or even a whole clause.

- Adverbs (e.g., 'quickly') are one-word adverbials. 
- Adverbial phrases (e.g., 'after dinner') and 
- adverbial clauses (e.g., 'although it's raining') are adverbials formed using multiple words

参考<br>
[Adverbial Phrases](https://www.scribbr.co.uk/syntax/adverbial/)<br>

#### 8.i.vi

这里有一个非常重要的背景--copula(linking verb)

>In linguistics, a copula (plural: copulas or copulae; abbreviated cop) is a word or phrase that links the subject of a sentence to a subject complement, such as the word is in the sentence "The sky is blue" or the phrase was not being in the sentence "It was not being co-operative." The word copula derives from the Latin noun for a "link" or "tie" that connects two different thing.
>
>A copula is often a verb or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the case.[3] A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a copulative or copular verb. In English primary education grammar courses, a copula is often called a linking verb

[Copula (linguistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_(linguistics))<br>

从wiki的解释可知，link and tie，所以中文的翻译连系动词，也合理。其实不如连接动词直接。

所以，正因为它是i.vi，才特别强调这个连接的作用。否则，vt就没有连接这样的语意，因为它是很自然的。

i.vi，以copula为基础，连接subject以及subject complementary.

- n. He looks happy.
- adj. He became a good student.
- noun clause. My trouble is that I have no money.
- adverbial phrase. He is in danger.

#### 9.如何判断i.vi

首先，对于vt/vi的判断方法上面讲了，按照对应的判断即可。
其次，判断句型：s + vi语意是否完整。

eg: become
- He becomes(not good, he becomes what?)
- He became happy.
- He became a good boy.(a good boy不是object，而是subject complementary)
    - 最上面已经判断了这是vi.
    - 其次，这个修饰主语.

#### 10.i.vi的形态

补充一些背景知识。非常base。

谓语--Predicate

>The predicate is one of the two main parts of a sentence (the other being the subject, which the predicate modifies).
>The predicate must contain a verb, and the verb requires or permits other elements to complete the predicate, or else precludes them from doing so. These elements are objects (direct, indirect, prepositional), predicatives, and adjuncts:

- She dances. — Verb-only predicate.
- Ben reads the book. — Verb-plus-direct-object predicate.
- Ben's mother, Felicity, gave me a present. — Verb-plus-indirect-object-plus-direct-object predicate.
- She listened to the radio. — Verb-plus-prepositional-object predicate.
- She is in the park. — Verb-plus-predicative-prepositional-phrase predicate.
- She met him in the park. — Verb-plus-direct-object-plus-adjunct predicate.

**The predicate provides information about the subject, such as what the subject is, what the subject is doing, or what the subject like.**

- In English, the subject and predicative nominal must be connected by a linking verb, also called a copula.
- The subject and predicative adjective must also be connected by a copula.

[Predicate (grammar)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicate_(grammar))

这里讲解了一些谓语的基础，其次提到了copula(linking verb)，紧接着，引出下面的内容。

- A predicative expression (or just predicative) is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula or linking verb
- The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject, but at times it can be the clause object.

[Predicative expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicative_expression)

这个东西，说的很清楚，主要是为了修饰主语。所以，也叫做主语补足语，当然，更常见的叫法是-表语。至于，为啥翻译成表语，不是很清楚。起码没有主语补足语好理解。

The most widely acknowledged predicative expressions are adjectives and nominals:

- The idea was ridiculous. — Predicative adjective over the subject.
- He seems nice. — Predicative adjective over the subject.
- Bob is a postman. — Predicative nominal over the subject.
- They were all happy campers. — Predicative nominal over the subject.
- That shrimp dish made him sick. — Predicative adjective over the object.
- We painted the door white. — Predicative adjective over the object.
- They elected him president. — Predicative nominal over the object.
- They called Jill a thief. — Predicative nominal over the object.

总结上面这些：
- i.vi. 目前我看到的，都是copula(linking verb)
- i.vi. 形态自然就是Predicative expression的形态。

下面总结下赖老师的讲义：
- a. noun. He is a big here.
- b. (noun clause)content clause. 
    - The trouble with me is that I lack money.
    - The probles is whether he can join us.
- c. noun phrase. The question is when to set out.
- d. gerund. My hobby is collecting stamps.
- e. infinitive with 'to'. My purpose here is to see him.
- f. adj. She is beautiful.
- g. adj(present participle) The story is interesting.
- h. adj(past participle) I am interested in the story.
- i. adj(prep phrase) The book is of great value.
- j. adv. 
    - She is there.
    - They are upstairs.
    - Is he home now?
- h. adv phrase
    - She is in town.
    - They are at home now.
    - She is in dange.

常见的表语形态总结如上，赖老师紧接着总结了be动词的一些用法区别

- be(linking verb)之后的现在分词(present participle)有两种词性。这里现在分词就是 V-ing的形式。
    - adj. The girl(s) is(corpula) charming(present participle as adj).
        - s + v + sc
    - present continuous. The girl(s) is singing(is singing is present continuous of sing.)
        - s + v
    - 这里主要体系be的不同用法，一是做单独的corpula，二是作为 present continuous的一部分。这点要区别开。
    - 因为这二者的句子结构完全不一致。
    - 这里我理解，赖老师的意思是，只要V-ing 这种形式，统称为present partiple
        - 其要么直接做adj
        - 要么作为present continuous的一部分。
    - 当然，V-ing的形式，除了present participle，还有gerund

- be(linking verb)之后的过去分词(past participle)同样有两种词性。这里过去分词就是 V-ed的形式
    - adj. The man(s) is(corpula) tired(past participle as adj).
    - passive voice. The man(s) was killed(was killed is past voice of kill)
    - 同上，be动词的不同用法，也是做单独的corpula，二是作为past voice的一部分。
    - 同上，二者有完全不同的结构。
    - V-ed，统称为past participle

赖老师的总结，和wiki的一致，主要是n and adj，这两种成分充当主语补足语，后者说是表语。这里还有意外之喜悦，即non-finite verbs的形态，有了进一步认知.
当然，V-ing还有一种形式是gerund，充当noun.也做一个总结：
- noun
    - gerund(V-ing)
    - infinitive with 'to'
- adj
    - present participle(V-ing)
    - past participle(V-ed)
- v
    - present continuous(V-ing)
    - passive voice(V-end)

V-ing的形式一致，但充当的作用不一样。这点要注意区别。

i.vi，其实就是讲corpula，主要是be verb，当然还有一些其他的形式
- become
- turn
- get
    - get用于present continouous，接形容词的比较级别，做sc
        - She is getting more and more beautiful.
        - Things are getting better and better.
    - get/be + passive voice.
        - He was/got killed in the accident.
        - If you are not careful, you'll be/get hurt.
- seem
    - seem + infinitive with 'to'
        - He seems to know it.
        - seems + adj/n时，to可以省略
            - He seems to be happy. = He seems happy.
            - He seems to be a nice man. = He seems a nice man
- verbs of perception
    - look. It looks interesting.
    - sound. His idea sounds good.
    - smell. The food smells good.
    - taste. The cheese taste well.
    - feel. I feel tired now.
    - 不可直接接名词，若接名词，需要 + like
        - It sounds like a good idea.
        - The material feels like sikl
        - The food tastes like fish.
        - feel like + n, 译为感觉像
            - When Jane said she would marry me, I felt like a newborn baby.
        - feel like + gerund，译为想要
            - I feel like taking a walk today. = I would like take a walk today.
    - feel/taste/smell亦可当c.vt，此时意思改变，不是...起来。直接翻译为对应的感官动作。
        - The doctor felt my forehead and said I had a fever.
        - Don't taste that food;it has spoiled.
        - He smelled sth burning.
    - look与介词连用时，可形成verb phrase, 视作vt.
        - He looked at me happily.
        - He looked into the case carefully.
        - 可以在i.vt与c.vt之间进行转换

i.vi有一个最大的特点是：**没有past voice**.

#### 11.i.vi的其他重要短语

- fall ill/fall asleep
- ran short
- came to be. I don't know how he came to be so pupular.
- prove to be. The document proved to be a forgery.

#### 12.c.vt

- c.vt具备active voice/past voice，此小节着重讨论active voice.

- 常见的结构：S + V + O
    - Peter loves music.
    - They want(c.vt) to go dancing(o).
    - He thinks(c.vt) that the book is good.(o)

    - that引导(that可省略)
        - I believe (that) he is a man of his word.
        - They feel (that) it is impossible to win the game.
        - 
    - whether引导(可与if互换)
        - I don't know whether(if) the typhoon will come.
        - I doubt if(whether) the man is competent enough to handle it.
        - 如下情形，不能替换
            - a.whether引导的c.c做subject.
                - Whether he can go is not yet known.
                - 这里如果想用if，用形式主语，把if放回宾语的位置：It is not yet know if(wheter) he can go.
            - b.whether引导的c.c做prep的object
                - He is worried about whether(if is wrong) he can pass the exam.
                - 确实是宾语，但是跟在prep之后，这个是规则。
            - c.whether引导的c.c做s.c
                - The problem is whether(if is wrong) he has enough meney for trip.
    - 疑问词引导
        - I don't know where he lives.
- 7.noun phrase as object.
    - I don't know how to solve the problem.
        - 这个为啥不是疑问词引导的c.c？
        - 因为除去疑问词之后，这不是一个句子。而是一个短语，充当名词成分，所以是名词短语
    - I don't know whom to talk to.

gerund其实是个动词的变体，为什么可以充当n?这么理解，翻译成汉语，V-ing这件事。
- I like playing computer games.
- 打游戏这件事，我喜欢。这件事是名词成分。

不管是n.c还是gerund/infinitive with to，都是尝试扩充句子的结构。

#### 14.i.vt.

- 还是及物动词，但是加了宾语之后，语意不完整。
- 需要加补足语，即object complementary

- He made a kite.(c.vt)
- He made Marry(wrong, i.vt)
    - He made Marry happy.(right, c.vt)
    - He made Marry clean the windown(这是 oc，不是状语)

        - Don't let him out.
        - His performace let me down.
        - 上述prep由于其后无宾语，可单独做副词用。因此也称作介副词。

            - He is there.
            - He is here.
