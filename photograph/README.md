### Basic

- Aperture
    - In optics, the aperture of an optical system (including a system consisted of a single lens) is a hole or an opening 
    - that primarily limits light propagated through the system.

    - Reducing the aperture size (increasing the f-number) provides less light to sensor 
    - and also increases the depth of field 
        - (by limiting the angle of cone of image light reaching the sensor),
        - which describes the extent to which subject matter lying closer than or farther from the actual plane of focus appears to be in focus.

- Focal length
    - The focal length of an optical system is a measure of how strongly the system converges or diverges light.
    - it is the inverse of the system's optical power.

- EP03
    - 光圈控制进光量，值越小，进光量越多，图像也越亮
    - 同时，影响景深。景深一浅，也就达到虚化的效果了。
- EP04
    - 焦段也可以影响景深，越小，景深约大。
    - 同时，好处在于。大光圈，进光量够，但是周围都虚了。配合小焦段，可以排出大光圈，但是周围不虚的照片.
    - 焦段/焦距，focal length，透镜中心到焦点的距离。这个值越小，视角越大。
