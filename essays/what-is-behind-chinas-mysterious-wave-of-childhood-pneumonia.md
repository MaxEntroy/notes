一篇短文，刚好今年流感非常严重，不管自己，还是家人也屡屡中招。追本溯源，看看有什么分析 

[What’s behind China’s mysterious wave of childhood pneumonia?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03732-w)

>Scientists expected a surge in respiratory disease, but what is happening in China is unusual.

## Phenomenon

- China is grappling with a surge in respiratory illnesses, including pneumonia, in children.-
- The World Health Organization (WHO) said last week that common winter infections — rather than any new pathogens — are behind the spike in hospitalizations。
- What is unusual, say epidemiologists, is the high prevalence of pneumonia in China. When COVID-19 restrictions were eased in other countries, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) drove most spikes in illness.

今年的呼吸道疾病到没什么新东西，正因为没什么新东西，这么高的感染率就有点不寻常了。

- However, an increase in children being admitted to hospital since May, particularly in northern cities such as Beijing, is mainly due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a bacterium that infects the lungs. 
- It is a common cause of ‘walking pneumonia’, a form of the disease that is usually relatively mild and doesn’t require bed rest or hospitalization, but that is hitting children hard this year.

紧接着说了一下今年的主角，支原体肺炎。说的好像不怎么严重，但实际好像有很多小孩高烧不退，主要是耐药性的问题。

 "It is happening slightly earlier this year, perhaps because of increased population susceptibility to respiratory infections resulting from three years of COVID measures."

 想起了今年说的各种脆皮梗，有点道理，之前有国家层面的防疫政策，相对保护的较好，一放开发现自己体内的免疫系统有点跟不上外部变化的世界了。所以，今年的第一场感冒比以往时候来的都早了些。

## A familiar pattern

- The rebound in common respiratory diseases during the first winter after the loosening of pandemic measures — such as mask-wearing and travel restrictions — has been a familiar pattern in other countries. 
- In November 2022, the number of people hospitalized with flu in the United States was the highest it had been for that time of year since 2010.

其他国家在早些时候也有类似的情况，所以这应该是一个有共识性的问题。然后作者说了他认为的原因：

> Nationwide lockdowns and other measures implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19 prevented seasonal pathogens from circulating, giving people **less opportunity to build up immunity against these microorganisms**, a phenomenon known as ‘immunity debt’, said Francois Balloux, a computational biologist at University College London, in a statement to the UK Science Media Centre. “Since China experienced a far longer and harsher lockdown than essentially any other country on Earth, it was anticipated that those ‘lockdown exit’ waves could be substantial in China,” said Balloux.

关于immune debts这个东西，我又问了下chatgpt，这个是不是个有共识的东西？

>[ChatGPT] "免疫债"（immune debts）是一个相对较新的概念，目前并没有被广泛接受或共识。该概念指的是在大流行病期间，由于缺乏充分的免疫保护，人群中可能会积累起未充分发展的免疫应答，从而导致未来的免疫挑战变得更加困难。这种情况可能会导致病毒的再次传播和疾病的复发。

尽管有些研究和专家提出了免疫债的概念，但这个观点还没有得到广泛的科学共识。目前，对于免疫债的存在和影响仍存在争议，需要更多的研究和证据来支持或否定这一观点。因此，免疫债是否被广泛认可取决于不同的科学界观点和研究结果。

所以，是不是一定能解释，还得再看看。

紧接着作者又说了下中国的特殊性，即为什么我们流行的是支原体肺炎，这个有点不一样。

- However, the Chinese wave of illness differs from that seen in other countries. Some nations grappled with flu and RSV infections during their post-COVID winter surges, but in China, M. pneumoniae infections have been common. 
- This is surprising because bacterial infections are often opportunistic and take hold after viral infections

## Summary

作者没有summary，因为我觉得他也没写什么conclusion，只是提出了一些现象，给了自己的一家之言而已。我自己总结下，作者认为中国情况特殊的地方在于
- 感染率非常高
- 支原体肺炎不应该这么流行

关于作者唯一的解释，免疫债这个东西听起来是符合一定道理的，外部一直在变化，但是自己自我封闭了，保的了一时，但也减慢了体内免疫系统应对外部变化的能力。不过，这个东西暂时没有行成共识。
