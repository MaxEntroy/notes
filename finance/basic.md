### Basic

#### Asset

- In financial accounting, an asset is any resource owned or controlled by a business or an economic entity.
- It is anything (tangible or intangible) that can be used to produce **positive economic value**. 
- Assets represent value of ownership that can be converted into cash 

简言之，能为你带来任何经济收益的东西。

#### Security (finance)

- A security is a tradable financial asset.
- The original meaning of "security," which dates back to the mid-15th century, was property pledged to guarantee some debt or promise of the owner.
- Starting in the 17th century, the word came to be used for a document evidencing a debt, and eventually for any document representing a financial investment.
- By the late 19th century, the word could refer to any tradeable investment — fixed income or equity or otherwise, and collateralized or not.

最早就是安全的保证，标明所有权和债券的文件。这个是经融资产。后来就衍生为任何可以用来靠谱交易的投资。
为什么靠谱？这其实就是security的保证。

#### Employee stock ownership plan，ESOP

员工认股制度（或员工持股计划，Employee stock ownership plan，ESOP）就是借由让员工认购公司的股票，成为公司的股东之一。 由于股东可以参与公司的分红，当公司赚愈多，股东也分得愈多，因此员工就会被激励更努力工作，为公司及自己同时创造财富。

#### Broker

- a person who buys and sells foreign money, shares in companies, etc., for other people
- a person who talks to opposing sides, especially governments, making arrangements for them or bringing disagreements to an end

人肉推荐系统。

#### Stock

- Stocks (also capital stock, or sometimes interchangeably, shares) consist of all the shares[a] by which ownership of a corporation or company is divided.
- A single share of the stock means fractional ownership of the corporation in proportion to the total number of shares.
